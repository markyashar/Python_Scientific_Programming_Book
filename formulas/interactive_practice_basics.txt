# 'import numpy' doesn't actually load a shared library. It loads a Python
# package, which is just a directory (named 'numpy' in this case) w/special
# file inside named '_init_.py. When a package is imported, the _init_.py is
# evaluated. It's usually used to import regular modules that exist inside the
# package, or even additional subpackages.

>>> from numpy import * 
>>> from numpy import linalg
>>> from numpy import linalg as la
>>> import numpy as n
>>> import numpy.linalg
